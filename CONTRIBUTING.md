Maybe you're not 100 percent sure whether what you've discovered
is a bug or the intended behavior. You can still file an issue
and tell us which results you'd expect.

If you know how to fix the issue you're welcome to send a pull
request. üí™

## Conventions

### Coding Style

This package follows the 
[PSR-2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) coding standard.
Linting can be executed using the `composer cs` command.

### Branching

The repo contains branches for every minor version and a master
branch up to date with the latest tagged version. For a bugfix
please send your pull request to the branch of the latest version
affected by the issue. If you're developing a new feature, branch
out from the master branch.

### Tests and linting

When you're making changes to this package please always run
tests and linting. Commands:  
`composer test`  
`composer cs`

Ideally you add the pre-commit git hook that is shipped with
this repo that will run tests and linting. Add it to your local
clone by running:  
`composer add-git-hooks`

Also please don't forget to add new test cases if necessary.

### Documentation

For any code change please don't forget to add an entry to the
`CHANGELOG.md` file and in case it's necessary also change the
`README.md` file.

When your pull request is merged I will show some love and tweet
about it. Also if you meet me in person I will be glad to buy you
a beer.
